        <p id="day1text" class="daystext" style="display:none;">Hiii bdbd! Enjoy your valentines day gift! Every single day it gets bigger and bigger with more on this website! ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ. The first reason that I love you is because of how different we are, it might sound weird but my life is boring and plain without you, every day i experience the same things and do the same things and never achieve my goals.... But with you I'm able to break out of the shell that I had and experience things and try new things, see new movies, go to new places, and finally live my life and feel so free. You make me a better human and allow me to see another whole side of life. Come back tomorrow for an even bigger reason and surprise!</p>

           The second thing I love about you is your deep caring attitude. I know sometimes you act like you don’t care but deep down I believe you truly care about me and I can see that in your actions. It warms my heart so much whenever after we fight we have a super sweet moment. I truly feel loved in these moments and I appreciate that so much.</p>

        <p id="day3text" class="daystext" style="display:none;">You love me even when I don't love myself. There have been so many times that I felt down on myself or bad about my skills and you always find a way to make me feel good about it. You tell me I'm smart and that I can do anything even though I feel like I cant. It's an amazing thing and it really shows your love because you can find the things about me that are actually good and still love me after seeing the things that are bad. I am so lucky to have someone like you that can bring out the amazing parts of me and make me feel like I have worth!
                                                                :)

        <p id="day4text" class="daystext" style="display:none;">Wow it's day 4 already, it's hard to imagine that tomorrow is valentines day! Today I want to talk about another big reason why I love you so much. You have the best personality in the world.. Even though we don't like all the same things, it doesn't even matter because you have a magical way of making things I don't like still fun. I love how you react to things and how you think about things. The way you laugh at all my jokes and care about me so much. I remember when I played games in the AirBNB and you acted like you cared about it and wanted to learn and watch me play ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ Even though you hate games you tried for me anyways and that means the world to me! I love how we both get excited by the simple things and care about them even if theres no real point ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I love how you always worry when I get sad and try to take care of me and we get sad together. It's all just so sweet and it makes your personality the best in the world. Oh and I'm now making an update to this ㅋㅋㅋㅋ Day 4 I was going to give you earth2 land but then turns out you got locked out of your account and now I cant do that ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ well jeez that definitely ruins my plan but I have a backup bdbd. Here I have made some coupons that you can use with me anytime! Take care of them and use them wisely! ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I love you bdbd! Oh yeah and you can still have the Earth2 land when get your account fixed so dont be sad about todays surprise ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ</p>

        <p id="story" class="story" style="display: none;">Hurtling through space at a speed of approximately 160,000 miles per hour, were a hoard of enormous meteors, heading straight to earth with the sole purpose of fucking up someone’s day. There’s no stopping these meteors, researchers have even tried to shoot them with nukes, but of course it was of no use, because those assholes just keep coming anyways. No one really knows why they always come towards earth, and it seems like no one really cares. But without fail, every single saturday, the meteors crash down into the same damn city at the same exact time. The crashing of these meteors is oftentimes misconstrued as music, but that’s just a common misconception, although I must admit the sound is quite beautiful. It’s kind of an event for everyone in the city and everyone stays wide awake for it, although that might not be by choice. For one family in particular though, the meteor crashing is quite the annoying occurrence.

            This story begins near the end of a hot and dreary September, half past midnight inside a car on the way to the families brand new house. Unfortunately for them, their house that they thought was top of the line, was actually a big piece of garbage. As Mr. Money drove through the piles of rubble and trash that lay in the parking lot, he had no idea the horrible situations that await him inside.
        
        “What is this place?” Mrs Honey said to her husband. “Did you look up the reviews before you bought this?”
        
        “Oh uhh…. yeah I did” He replied “it’s going to be fine just wait until we get inside” 
        
        Mr Money jumped out of the car nervously and started picking up all their luggage. It wasn’t even a challenge to him…. you couldn’t possibly fit enough luggage into the car to make it a challenge for him. He was so strong in fact, he could easily carry up to 20 bags in each arm and have his wife on his shoulders at the same time, while also pushing 2 other bags with his feet. He was so strong that in the past he had looked like quite a freak to the people around town, anytime he walked outside, bodybuilders would stop and stare in amazement and beg him for advice.  
        
        “Listen babe, I got all of this… just go inside and hold the door open for me” 
        
        “Oh yeah?” Mrs Money replied, “are you seriously being sexist right now? Give me some of those bags I can easily carry them in” 
        
        Unfortunately for Mr. Money, his only weakness in this world and the only thing that could ever make him weak, was his wife. He loved her so much in fact, that one month after they started dating he purposely lost all of his muscle just so he wouldn’t make her look so small, and it would probably be helpful if I mention that she was a midget, well compared to him anyways. Mr. Money grumpily obliged and gave her 2 bags.
        
        Their house was a tall and wide multi-home building with mold growing on the top of the roof and draping over the sides. Multiple windows were broken out effectively making the building security worthless as they only patrolled the ground floor. One guard though, was particularly horrible, as he was absolutely terrified of anything hot. Whenever his coworkers would cook their lunch in the microwave he would scream loud enough to wake up the entire city block. 
        
        As Mr and Mrs Money walked up the stairs to their home door they noticed a sharp breeze coming from inside. They rushed inside to see that every window in the house was wide open and to make matters worse, they were unable to close. Mrs. Money didn’t even care about the problems at this point because it was so late and she just wanted to get to sleep, Mr. Money on the other hand was noticeably worried, the main thing he cared about in life was making his wife happy, and he was clearly letting her down. He walked over to his wife and gave her a big hug and carried her into the bedroom, throwing her down on the bed.
        
        “I’m so sorry about this…” he said sadly.
        
        “Sorry about what honey?” She replied
        
        “I’m sorry about this house, I know it’s not what you expected…”
        
        “Oh no it’s absolutely fine!” she said, “I love it so much! This is a perfect home for us” 
        
        What she didn’t know at the time was that her words meant the world to him. She was so happy even with the smallest things, and grateful even for things she didn’t want. She was the perfect woman. He got into bed next to her and snuggled up to her tightly s 
        
        Their cute moment was ruined by a sharp “BOOM!” 
        Everything in the house shook, Mrs. Midget, I mean Money, fell over off the bed and knocked her coffee all over her brand new pajamas. He helped her up and then they stumbled over to the window to look outside. To their surprise, there was absolutely nothing, it’s as if the boom came from nowhere, they covered the window, laid back down, and then “BOOM!” , another blast shook their house. Mr Money jumped up from the bed, blocked off the window with everything he could find, and laid back in bed. 
        
        “BOOM!, BOOM!, BOOM! BOOM!, BOOM!, BOOM”, the booms just wouldn’t stop; it was impossible for them to sleep. They tried covering their ears but it was no use, the meteors were just far too loud.
        
        “Okay honey… fuck it, just turn those rain sounds on so we can sleep, and by the way,  can you please get up and cover up the tv?” 
        </p>
